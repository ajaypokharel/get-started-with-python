# Contribution Guidelines
----
* Recently quality of online tutorials has diminished, therefore only tutorials with comprehensive lecture material which cover a subject/topic in ample detail should be added. For example, long tutorials attempting to cover huge range of topics (eg. Learn Python in 7 hours) should be avoided.
* While adding the problem sets, few considerations should be taken:
	* Does the problem set touches the basic concepts of the tutorials added on that topic?
	* Are they easy to read and understand? Are there appropriate test cases/examples provided to help learners comprehend?
* One philosophy used in this list is that link should directly point to videos for viewing/downloading than registration and waiting for the next session. If videos are directly accessible through the platform/youtube or any other source, please use the direct source. Do not use courses from sites that require access/payments.
