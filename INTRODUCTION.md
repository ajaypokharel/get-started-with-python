<h1>Introduction</h1>

* The purpose of this list is to provide a pathway for beginner Python programmers to access free online courses and build their Python programming skills from the start. This list is intended for absolute beginners and people who have never done programming before. If you want to dive into programming and have no clue where to start and how to proceed ahead, this list will help you. The list is inspired by my own journey into Python programming. Rather than reading 70 pages of text from a book, you can utilize the instruction on this list to find the right course and start learning.
* It is recommended that you do not skip steps in the list if you want to have a full-fledged knowledge of Python. After each course, you should also consider practicing the **Problem Sets** linked to each course.
* Should you have any challenges solving the problems or understanding the materials, I recommend using resources such as [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to find the solutions or understand the concept in depth before diving into the problem.
* Disclaimer: The links have been taken from public domain websites like Open Courseware sites, YouTube channels, Coding Websites, Google, Blog posts, articles etc. If you are the instructor/owner for any course listed below and would like your course to be removed from the list, please raise an issue with course details.
