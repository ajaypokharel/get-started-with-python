## Python Integers and Numbers Problems


1. What are the different types of numbers in Python? Give examples of each.

2. What is does the each `print()` function print in the following program?

   ```python
   num_1 = 4
   num_2 = 3.0
   
   print(num_1 + num_2)
   
   
   num_1 = 7
   num_2 = 3.78
   
   print(num_1 - num_2)
   
   print(float(11))
   
   print(1.1 + 2.2)	# this could be something you might not expect
   
   print(decimal.Decimal('1.1') + decimal.Decimal('2.2'))
   
   ```

   

3. In problem 2, the last two print functions show something unique about Python numbers. Read more on this [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/numbers). What does this teach you about numbers in programming?
