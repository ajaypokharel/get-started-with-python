## Python Strings Problems

*Note: This will contain a mix of problems I have created with the problems on platform such as HackerRank. If you do not have an account, I would recommend making one.* Do not get intimidated by the name Hackerrank. You are not doing any hacking (not yet!)

Also do not get intimidated by keywords such as `def` or concepts like loops and conditionals. If you are not familiar with those concepts, you can skip Problem 6 and 7, but give it a try!

1. Write a Python program to count the number of times the letter 'a' is in a given string. If there is none, return zero. Here's how your program might look like:

   ```python
   def count_a(input_string):
       # your code here
       return # count of the letter 'a' or 0
   ```

2.  What is wrong with the program below? List out all the problems you see!

   ```Python
   name = 'Hello World"
   is_python = ""
   I am writing this to demonstrate nothing,
   and test if you can figure out a problem, if there is one!
   ""
   result = 'Ajay' + 27
   
   # Hint, if you cannot find the problem, try running these in a python shell
   
   ```

6. Common Characters: Suppose you are given two strings as an input. You have to write a program to check how many characters are present in both of the strings.

   ```
   For example:
   input1 = "Coding"
   input2 = "Programming"
   
   Output = 4 (the only characters present in both inputs are 'o', 'i', 'n' 'g. Note that 'g' repeats two times in 'Programming'. You have to write the program in such a way that it ignores the repeatations)
   ```

   Your program might look like this:

   ```python
   def count_repeat(string_1, string_2):
       # your code here
      	return # an integer or 0 if no common characters
   ```
