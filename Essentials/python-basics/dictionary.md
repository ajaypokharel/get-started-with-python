## Python Dictionary Problems

*Note: This will contain a mix of problems I have created with the problems on platform such as HackerRank. If you do not have an account, I would recommend making one.* Do not get intimidated by the name Hackerrank. You are not doing any hacking (not yet!)

Also do not get intimidated by keywords such as `def` or concepts like loops and conditionals. If you are not familiar with those concepts, you can skip Problem 6 and 7, but give it a try!

1. What is wrong with the dictionary below?
	```python
	dict_1 = { 1: 'hello', 4: 'hi', 8: 23, 33: [1, 2, 3], 1: '33'}
	```
	
2. What does the following lines of code output? 
	```python
	dict_1 = {1: 'Python', 2: 'Java', 3: 'Go', 4: 'C'}
	dict_1[3] = 'React'
	dict_1[5] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
	print(dict_1)
	```
3. You are given a list of numbers `num`. You have to return `True` if there's a duplicate number in the list. Return `False` if there is no duplicate.
	For example:
	```python
	num = [1, 2, 5, 66, 2232, 523434, 968, 9, 0, 3, 5, 1] // should return True
	num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99, 23, 554, 1242, 5940] // should return False
	```
4. You are given a dictionary with keys that are alphanumeric (numbers and letters). Find the mean/average of the numerical keys. Round to the nearest two decimal points.
	Example:
	` dict_1 = {1: 'hello', 'a': 'python', 3: 45, 76: 'world', 'john': 'Java'}`
	Output = (1 + 3 + 76) / 3 = 26.67
5. You are given a string `my_words`. Find all the duplicates in the string and output them in a list. The characters are case-sensitive.
	Example:
	`my_words = 'monkeyHasBeenCaught'`
	Output = `['n', 'e', 'a' ]`
	
6. What does it mean for a data type in Python to be Hashable? List all the hashable and unhashable datatypes in Python.
