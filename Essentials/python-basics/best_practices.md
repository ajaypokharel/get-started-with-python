## Best Practice to Go through Python Basics Tutorial

This tutorial covers basic data types in Python and some of the key concepts in Python programming such as loops, conditionals, and functions. Here are some best practices to make the best out of the selected tutorials in the list:

1. Take Notes--always! Buy a new notebook if you have to or type notes, if you prefer.
2. Do not skip any tutorial or videos. You might notice repeated concepts in another tutorial, but I have found rewatching a same concept really sticks it to the memory.
3. Practice the problems in every section, if you can. Seek help if you are not able to solve a problem. Research, google--that is what makes a good programmer. Understand how life-saving StackOverflow is!
4. Enjoy the experience, too. And don't forget to take a break once in a while!
