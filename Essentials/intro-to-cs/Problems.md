   if x % 2 == 0:
       # what should be the print statement here
   else:
       # what should be the print statement here

7. Consider the pseudocode below:

   ```pseudocode
   function newFunc(x, y):
   	result = x * y
   	return result
   
   newFunc(3, 9)
   
   ```

   What does the function return?
