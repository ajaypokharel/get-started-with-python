Here are some tips to make the best out of Introduction to Computer Science section:

* __Take Notes__: Note taking is an essential part of learning theory of CS. It's always better to refer to your notes than to search for that exact
moment in the tutorial
* Harvard's CS50 course is highly recommended. If you are picking only one to watch, I would watch that.
* Solve the problem sets. These problems are specialized not to test your skills but to remind you of certain concepts in programming. Do not miss them!
* Welcome to the world of Programming! It's gonna be a ride.
